1. How to run the application: use cd command go to the SocailPlatform floder and input " ng build", then go back to root folder of this application and 
input command "node server", then open your broswer go to url "localhost:/3000"

2. Service is used for a specific functions, in this application, we can use service to connect to the back-end. In SocailPlatform/src/app/services, there 
is a service I have already built, and the service is used in sort component.

3. As simple as that, whatever you want to do, like get the data from back-end, or add data to the back-end, you can just write a service file to achieve it,
I will finish some other common service like get, post, add , delete, update, if your component requires other service, let me know and I will help you.

4. This application is basicly all set, so try to wrtie code and finish our final project. Be free to contact me if you are still confused about the flow between 
font-end and back-end.
